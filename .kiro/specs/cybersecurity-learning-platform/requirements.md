- **Progress_Tracker**: System component that monitors and records user learning advancement
- **Lesson_Module**: Individual educational units covering specific cybersecurity topics
- **User_Account**: Registered learner profile with authentication and progress data
- **Assessment_System**: Component that evaluates user knowledge and practical skills
- **Language_Selector**: Interface component allowing users to switch between Euskera and Spanish

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity student, I want to access structured learning paths from beginner to advanced levels, so that I can systematically develop my penetration testing skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Platform SHALL provide three distinct skill levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced
2. WHEN a user completes a Lesson_Module, THE Progress_Tracker SHALL automatically unlock the next sequential lesson
3. THE Learning_Platform SHALL display a visual progress indicator showing completion percentage for each skill level
4. WHILE a user is enrolled in a learning path, THE Learning_Platform SHALL maintain their progress across sessions
5. WHERE a user selects a skill level, THE Learning_Platform SHALL present lessons appropriate to that proficiency level

### Requirement 2

4. WHILE viewing any lesson content, THE Learning_Platform SHALL maintain consistent language throughout the entire module
5. THE Learning_Platform SHALL provide identical learning objectives and assessments in both supported languages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pentesting learner, I want to practice on realistic vulnerable web applications, so that I can apply theoretical knowledge in a safe, controlled environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Platform SHALL provide at least 15 different Vulnerable_Lab environments covering common web vulnerabilities
2. WHEN a user accesses a Vulnerable_Lab, THE Learning_Platform SHALL deploy an isolated instance within 30 seconds
3. THE Vulnerable_Lab SHALL include common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and authentication bypasses
4. WHILE a user is practicing in a Vulnerable_Lab, THE Learning_Platform SHALL provide guided hints and explanations
5. THE Learning_Platform SHALL reset each Vulnerable_Lab to its initial state after each practice session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to track student progress and performance, so that I can provide appropriate guidance and assess learning outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Progress_Tracker SHALL record completion status for each Lesson_Module with timestamps
2. WHEN a student completes an assessment, THE Assessment_System SHALL store the score and provide detailed feedback
3. THE Learning_Platform SHALL generate progress reports showing time spent, modules completed, and skill assessments
4. WHILE reviewing student data, THE Learning_Platform SHALL display performance analytics and learning patterns
5. THE Learning_Platform SHALL allow educators to export progress data in standard formats (CSV, PDF)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity student, I want interactive lessons with multimedia content and practical exercises, so that I can engage with the material effectively and retain knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lesson_Module SHALL include video demonstrations, interactive diagrams, and step-by-step tutorials
2. WHEN a user starts a lesson, THE Learning_Platform SHALL present content in a structured sequence with clear navigation
3. THE Lesson_Module SHALL include hands-on exercises that require practical application of concepts
4. WHILE completing exercises, THE Learning_Platform SHALL provide real-time feedback on user actions
5. THE Learning_Platform SHALL include knowledge check quizzes at the end of each major topic section

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want access to advanced penetration testing scenarios and tools, so that I can develop professional-level skills and stay current with industry practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Platform SHALL provide advanced scenarios covering network penetration, web application security, and social engineering
2. WHEN accessing advanced content, THE Learning_Platform SHALL require completion of prerequisite intermediate modules
3. THE Learning_Platform SHALL integrate with common penetration testing tools and frameworks (Metasploit, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)
4. THE Vulnerable_Lab SHALL include enterprise-level scenarios with multiple interconnected systems
5. THE Learning_Platform SHALL provide certification preparation materials aligned with industry standards (CEH, OSCP, CISSP)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a secure and reliable learning environment, so that I can focus on learning without technical disruptions or security concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Platform SHALL authenticate users through secure login mechanisms with password complexity requirements
2. WHEN users access Vulnerable_Lab environments, THE Learning_Platform SHALL isolate each session to prevent interference
